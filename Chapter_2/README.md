# Deterministic creation and braiding of chiral edge vortices

The codes contained in this directory are used to calculate the numerical results including the band dispersion, current density and also scattering phase, as described in Chapter 6 of *Strategies for braiding and ground state preparation in digital quantum hardware*  (ISBN 978-90-8593-521-6). Please use the respective jupyter notebooks and the instructions contained therein.
