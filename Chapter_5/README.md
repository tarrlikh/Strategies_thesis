# Diagrammatic technique for variational quantum ansatzes

Quantum Combinatorial Ansatz is a hierarchical ansatz construction based on stabilizer theory and diagrammatic perturbation theory, as introduced in Quantum 5, 596 (2021), and described in Chapter 6 of *Strategies for braiding and ground state preparation in digital quantum hardware*  (ISBN 978-90-8593-521-6).

The code in this repository is used to generate the ansatz circuits of QCA type and simulate the performance of a variational algorithm.
