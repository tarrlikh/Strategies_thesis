# Measurement-driven navigation in many-body Hilbert space

Measurement-driven navigation is a dissipative state preparation protocol Quantum 5, 596 (2021), and described in Chapter 7 of *Strategies for braiding and ground state preparation in digital quantum hardware*  (ISBN 978-90-8593-521-6).

The code in this repository is used to simulate the performance of MDN, in particular the data displayed in Chapter 7. Please use the notebook Plotting.ipynb to process and display data, and Simulations_run.ipynb to generate new data. (further instructions are contained therein)
